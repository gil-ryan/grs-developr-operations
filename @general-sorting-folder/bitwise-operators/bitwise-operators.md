# Bitwise Operators

| Operator  | Description | Example |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| & | bitwise AND | Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands (a & b means 0000 1100) |
| \| | bitwise OR | (a \| b means 0011 1101) |
| ^ | bitwise exclusive OR| It copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. (a^b) = 49 (means 0011 0001)| 
| << | shift left | The left operands value is moved left by the nuber of bits specified by the right operand. a << 2 = 240 (means 1111 0000)|
| >> | shift right| The left operand value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. a >> 2 = 15 (means 0000 1111)
| ~ | one's complement| It is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits. (~a) = -61 (means 1100 0011) in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number |
